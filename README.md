# Terrarium
Is a practice of the Web-Dev-For-Beginners's course of Microsoft. Almost all of the code is exactly the same as the course one because it was my first practice and I was copying it while I was understanding it. I added a reflection in the terrarium by myself using the HTML and CSS learned in the lesson.
